/// A raw exclusive lock, this implementation is for any lock that can only be locked once
/// for any time slice.
///
/// Some examples include `RwLock`'s writer locks and `RefCell`'s `RefMut`, and
/// `Mutex`'s locks.
///
/// # *exc lock*
///
/// Throughout this documentation you may see references to *shr lock*. A *exc lock* represents a single lock
/// resource. This resource prevents any thread from acquiring another *exc lock*
/// (except by using [`SplittableExclusiveLock::exc_split`]) or acquiring any [*shr lock*](crate::share_lock::RawShareLock#shr-lock)s
///
/// One acquires ownership of a *exc lock* by calling [`RawExclusiveLock::exc_lock`], by
/// [`RawExclusiveLock::exc_try_lock`] if it returns true, and finally by calling [`SplittableExclusiveLock::exc_split`]
///
/// One releases a *exc lock* by calling [`RawExclusiveLock::exc_unlock`] or [`RawExclusiveLockFair::exc_unlock_fair`]
///
/// A the owner of a *exc lock* must repsect the trait bounds specified by [`RawLockInfo::ExclusiveGuardTraits`].
/// This means that if [`RawLockInfo::ExclusiveGuardTraits`] is not [`Send`], then the *exc lock* cannot be transferred across
/// thread boundries, and if it isn't [`Sync`], then the *exc lock* cannot be shared across thread boundries
///
/// All of these rules are enforced in a safe way through [`RawExclusiveGuard`].
///
/// ### `exc_split`
///
/// It is possible to hold multiple *exc lock* resources at the same time, by using [`SplittableExclusiveLock::exc_split`].
/// In this case, each *exc lock* must guard access to completely disjoint resources.
///
/// # Safety
///

/// `exc_try_lock`, `shr_lock`, or `try_shr_lock` can succeed (for the last two,
/// provided that `RawShareLock` is implemented)
